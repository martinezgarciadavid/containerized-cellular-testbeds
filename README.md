## About

The main goal of this repository is to provide testbed scenarios for cellular mobile communications networks (e.g., LTE/4G/5G) using _Containerlab_ (based on _Docker_ containers).

While _Docker_ provides _Docker Compose_ for defining and deploying complex, multi-container scenarios, the networking part of it (inter-container connectivity) is arguably still a little bit complicated. Therefore, it is interesting to use other tools that simplify this task, so here is where _Containerlab_ comes into play. This tool provides an easy way of defining network topologies and scenarios by using a standard definition language (YAML). And by leveraging existent _Linux_ bridging and switching software, such as _Open vSwitch_, we can use it to define custom, modular scenarios that can be interconnected in a handful of different ways.

The idea is to provide different scenarios that can be used to deploy and test complete cellular networks. The core network is provided using _Containerlab_ topologies, and the RAN can be deployed using any simulated or _physical_ implementation. The scenarios can be interconnected, so it is possible to, for example, add an IMS and provide VoLTE, or extend the networks in any way you may imagine.

### Requisites

In order to run the scenarios, you need to have the following:
- A machine running either a native or virtualized 64-bit _Linux_ operating system with a fairly good amount of available RAM and storage.
	- Depending on your system limitations and the usage of your operating system, a good, minimum recommendation would be to have 16 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. However, a more limited system could also run these scenarios without issues.
	- Since the core functionality of the scenarios runs on _Docker_ containers, any _Linux_ distribution can be used. However, for maximum compatibility of libraries and dependencies we have used _Ubuntu 20.04 LTS_ and _Ubuntu 22.04 LTS_. You may want to use these or newer versions. Nevertheless, if you prefer another distribution, feel free to use it, but notice that the installation instructions for any library and dependency will vary.
	- If you use _Windows_ 10 or 11, _WSL2_ may work, but bear in mind that we haven't tested it.
- You can find the installation instructions for _Containerlab_ along with more documentation at this link: https://containerlab.dev/install/. This tool relies on _Docker_, so you must also install it on your machine.
- Some inter-container connectivity relies on _Open vSwitch_ bridges, so you must install it as well.
- The connectivity between _Containerlab_ topologies, and between scenarios and the Internet is done via the `virbr0` bridge provided by the `libvirt` library, so you must install it.
- For traffic capturing, you need to install _Wireshark_ on your system.

## General instructions

### 1.- Building _Docker_ images

You need to build the _Docker_ images for all containers. Follow these steps (assuming you have a terminal opened at this project's root directory):

```bash
# For UERANSIM containers:
$ cd docker/ueransim/
$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t giros-dit/ueransim:latest .

# For srsRAN 4G containers:
$ cd docker/srsran-4g/
$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t giros-dit/srsran-4g:latest .

# For srsRAN Project containers:
$ cd docker/srsran-project/
$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t giros-dit/srsran-project:latest .

# For Open5GS containers:
$ cd docker/open5gs/
$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t giros-dit/open5gs:latest .

# For MongoDB container (Open5GS subscriber database):
$ cd docker/mongodb/
$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t giros-dit/mongodb:latest .
```

### 2.- Deploying scenarios

In the ![`containerlab`](containerlab) directory there are several subdirectories with different testbed scenarios that can be used. Inside each subdirectory you can find the following structure:

- A `README` file with information about the scenario and instructions on how to deploy, destroy and interact with it.
- A `conf` subdirectory with configuration files for each container that composes the scenario.
- A `topologies` subdirectory with _Containerlab_ topology definition files for the scenario.
- A `scripts` subdirectory with shell scripts for deploying/destroying/interacting with the scenario.

### 3.- Capturing traffic with _Wireshark_

This command serves as a template to capture traffic with _Wireshark_ in any container. You just need to replace `<clab-container-name>` with the desired _Containerlab_ container name and `<container-interface>` with the desired network interface inside the container.
The name of the container can be obtained right after deploying the topology or by executing the `docker container ps -a` command.

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec <clab-container-name> tcpdump -l -nni <container-interface> -w - | wireshark -k -i -
```

If the above command does not work, you can directly open _Wireshark_, select the desired container interface and start capturing traffic right away.

**NOTE:** It is recommended to enable all protocols under the `Analyze` -> `Enabled protocols` menu from the top bar.

### Other - SSH access to containers

You can SSH to the containers deployed in any scenario with the following set of credentials:
- Username: `root` - Password: `gprsumts`.
- Username: `admin` - Password: `admintelecom`.
